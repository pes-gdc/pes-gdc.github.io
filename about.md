Today, video games have evolved far beyond just a fun pass time for kids. Just like
 art, music and films, video games have become a strong medium of expression and 
 creativity. 

Founded in September 2017, the PES Game Dev Club serves as a hub for students across all branches
 to come together to discuss and explore the creation of video games: how they work, what it 
 takes to make them, and why we play them.

Our aim is to build a diverse community of students with a passion for playing, 
understanding and developing video games, and provide a platform for them to 
expand their knowledge and express their passion by holding discussions, events, 
workshops and more.
