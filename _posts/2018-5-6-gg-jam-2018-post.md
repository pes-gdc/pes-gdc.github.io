On 28th April 2018, we hosted **GG Jam 2018**, PES's first ever 24 hour video game hackathon. 
Teams had to create a video game, from the ground up, based on the theme: **Energy**!

Over the course of the next 24 hours, 16 teams slogged it out to create their own unique game,
and stand a chance to win one of our 5 cash prizes. 

At the end, the games were judged and winners decided by our judges:
* **Rakshith Anand**, a PESIT Alumni and the Founder of [RedForce Games](https://www.redforcegames.com/).
