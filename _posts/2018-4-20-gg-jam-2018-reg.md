## FAQs

**Q. What sort of software can we use?**

Any set of software, game engines, programing languages, coding libraries,  content creation tools can be used.

**Q. For what platform do we make the game?**

The final game, once built should run on a Windows PC. Most game engines have an option to build for Windows, irrespective of the OS being used. If this is still not possible, we will make special arrangements on the day of the event.

**Q. I do not have any experience in coding. How can I make a video game?**

There are alot of tools available to create games without coding. They usually use a form of visual scripting instead, which is much simpler to use.   You can look here to get started <https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/how-to-make-a-game-without-coding/>

**Q. I do not have a team. Can I still participate?**
 
Yes. You can make a game solo. You can also form new teams with others, or join an existing team on the day of the event.
 
 **Q. I have already registerd my team, but a friend wants to join now.**
 
 Your friend can register as a separate team. You can join teams on the day of the hackathon. The max size of a team is still 4 members.

 We will have a number of prizes for different categories. Not just the top 3 games. We want you to play to your strengths while making a game. 
 Whether coder, designer, artist,  musician  or something else, use what you are good at to make your game unique and engaging.
